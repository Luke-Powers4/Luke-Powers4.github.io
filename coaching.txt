 <h2>Noobs in Overwatch 2 
</h2>
<p>New players would probably be playing soldier 76 as its the character that is used in the tutorial and is easy to play. New players don't really cooperate as a team as well as mid-lvl or adv players. Sometimes noobs pick characters that look cool but aren't good at.

<h2>Mechanics of the game 
</h2>
<p>1. The way to win a match changes with game modes but I'm just going to talk about capture the point. The goal of capture the point is to be in your teams point radius for as long as possible and stop the other team from doing the same.</p>
<p>2. If your a healer a good strategy is to priorities healers then tanks then everyone else.</p>
<p>3. Overwatch is pretty easy to pick up and has a high skill ceiling depending on the character.</p>

<h2>Strategy</h2>
<p>Clip one: I will show how to best use the healers by demonstrating the priorities for healing 
</p>
<hr class="dotted">
<p>Clip two: I will show the importance of sound cues by hearing an ultimate (without seeing it) and determining who's ultimate it is and how to doge it.
</p>
<hr class="dotted">
<p>clip three: I will show the importance of always shooting by comparing me trying to find the "perfect shot" and me always shooting.
</p>
<hr class="dotted">
<p>clip four: I will show the importance of utilizing melee as its fast and can do a nice chunk of damage as well as demonstrate effective use of melee.
</p>
<hr class="dotted">
<p>clip five: I will show a better use of ice wall on mai by demonstrating how blocking half the team from each other is better than just blocking the whole team.
