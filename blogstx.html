      <p>Toxicity in gaming is similar to toxicity in real-life and comes from the same place. Where they differ is that in real life you have to put yourself out there and be able to take what people throw at you to be toxic, which is something most people aren't willing to do. In Gaming (at least online gaming) you don't have to risk as much because you know that you probably won't be seeing that person again and you can just leave at any time. This allows for games or really anything online to be a perfect environment for toxicity as they see it, really have nothing to lose. People who are toxic in general are usually that way because they are unhappy with themselves and need a way to take out their. </p>
      <p>frustration onto other people. Though being combative may seem like the best course of action at first glance, this rarely works and will only provoke this person's actions further. nothing you can say will be worse than what they say two inches from the mirror. Instead the best course of action is to try to make the best of the situation. You can't really do much to make this person less toxic in that moment as that is an emotional issue that person has. work with whatever they throw at you (within reason) and try to have a good time anyways. There's no really combating toxicity, it's going to be something that will always be there. https://intenta.digital/gaming/toxicity-hate-and-harassment-in-gaming/ </p>
