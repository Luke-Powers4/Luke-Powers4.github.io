  <h2>Toxicity in gaming</h2>
  <p> Toxicity in gaming is similar to toxicity in real-life and comes from the same place. Where they differ is that in real life you have to put yourself out there and be able to take what people throw at you to be toxic, which is something most people aren't willing to do. In Gaming (at least online gaming) you don't have to risk as much because you know that you probably won't be seeing that person again and you can just leave at any time. This allows for games or really anything online to be a perfect environment for toxicity as  they see it, really have nothing to lose. People who are toxic in general are usually that way because they are unhappy with themselves and need a way to take out their frustration onto other people. Though being combative may seem like the best course of action at first glance, this rarely works and will only provoke this person's actions further. nothing you can say will be worse than what they say two inches from the mirror. Instead the best course of action is to try to make the best of the situation. You can't really do much to make this person less toxic in that moment as that is an emotional issue that person has. work with whatever they throw at you (within reason) and try to have a good time anyways.
There's no really combating toxicity, it's going to be something that will always be there.

 <h2>Risk of Rain 2 Review Review
 </h2>
 <p>Review: https://www.codewithmike.com/risk-of-rain-2-review/
This review on risk of rain 2 has a lot of takes that I agree with but only really one thing I don't. He mentions how great the soundtrack is and I have to agree, I still listen to the soundtrack and I have multiple songs on my playlist. Another thing he mentions is the replayability with tons of different item combinations and I agree with this statement too. He mentions the variety in the classes and how each of them feel different and fun in their own way. This is one of my favorite parts of Risk of Rain 2. Playing a different character is a big refresher and they are just fun to play. One thing he says that I don't agree with is that some of the hidden areas are a bad thing. I feel they bring mystery when you find them and it's cool to find them for the first time. Also he says they are hard to find and I feel they are easy to find. In conclusion i for the most part agree with this review but that one part i just mention i don't really agree wit </p>

 <h2> My Dream Computer
 </h2>
 <p> My Dream Computer will be a PC. It will be used  for games and whatever programs I need. I am willing to spend any amount of money necessary to achieve my goal and I will buy it assembled. I think the Next Computing The Edge DL would be a great fit for me. At $54,950 the edge DL can take whatever I throw against it as long as itâ€™s not physical.

<h2>Cloud 9 team analysis </h2>
<p>Cloud 9 is one of my favorite LOL esports teams. Cloud 9 established 8 divisions in 2014 and won three international championships in 2018. What makes cloud 9 so good is their petal to the metal gameplay to overwhelm the opposing team, as well as their willingness to not underestimating opponents makes them a force to be reckoned with. One thing cloud 9 needs to work on is cleaner, tighter and consistent gameplay.
